# Exercise 9: Javascript Data Types and Data Structures; Intro to jQuery

Today we learned about Javascript's data types and data structures; we also introduced a new tool, jQuery! 

##### Links from class

- [jQuery docs](https://api.jquery.com/): documentation for the jQuery library. Use this as a reference when you write your own queries. 

### Prepare for next class

We'll be diving deep into jQuery's methods for animation and events. 

## In Class Exercise

- Create a simple function named `onClickHandler`.
- Create a button using html and css, assign it the id of `clickButton`. Style it however you want and give it some arbitrary text.
- Using jQuery, select the `clickButton` by it's id and assign a `click` event to it that calls the `onClickHandler` function you created in step one.
