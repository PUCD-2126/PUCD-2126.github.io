No but really it does. If you've ever wondered why your updates don't automatically appear when you push them up to production environments, we'll it's probably because of many layers of caching. Without caching the WWW wouldn't feel good.

### Prepare for next class
As you did last week bring your questions & comments on the *Readings & other media* assigned. Bring your computer to class, you'll need it.

We will continue working on the repo we created in class this week.

##### Concepts:
- Caching
- HTTP: the protocol and what it means
- Debugging
- Developer tools
- Proxies

Before coming into class you'll need to have enabled **developer tools** on your browsers. Instructions on how to do that are here:

- [Enable chrome dev tools](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/enable-chrome-os-developer-mode-try-new-features) 
- [Use the Safari Develop menu](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/use-the-safari-develop-menu-sfri20948/mac) 

##### Further exploration:

- [Full Using Chrome developer tools playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV9PLPFTnkE&list=PLfdtiltiRHWEQ6wtGVC57qrlRtQPyylya)
- [TED Talk: What is the Internet, really? - Andrew Blum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE_FPEFpHt4)

### In Class assignment

Ensure you have enabled **developer tools** on your browsers. See instructions above on how to do that. We will be debugging and fixing some common bugs! In fact, if you have anything needing some debugging, bring it in. We'll dive into it together.

##### Lab assignment page
- create a page that lists lab assignments. Get creative, think about using an `<ul>` or `<ol>`.
- submit a pull request with adding your name and github handle [here](https://github.com/PUCD-2126/PUCD-2126.github.io/blob/master/_data/students.json). keep in mind you'll need to use git to collaborate; you might have to resolve a git conflict.

##### Debug html page
- navigate to the debug page
- use your developer tools -- inspector tab -- to look for bugs
