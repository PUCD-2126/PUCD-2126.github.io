# Exercise 5: Web Layouts - the box model & document flow

I introduced a couple new tools today: [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) / [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) & [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

- nodejs -- or the `node` command we used in your terminal today -- is a runtime for the Javascript language. That's a fancy way of saying "it runs Javascript code". We'll use this later in the semester, but for today we only installed it.
- npm -- the package manager for nodejs -- is a tool that helps you get libraries for nodejs. It comes bundled with nodejs and we used it today to install `http-server`.
- http-server is a tool for running server in your current working directory on your computer. To use this, navigate to a directory you want to run a server off of by using the `cd` command. When you're there run `http-server` and it should display a couple of urls prefaced with `http://`. The first one is a locally accessible one -- the one you want to use most of the time -- and the second one is a publicly accessible url -- use this if you want someone to access your code from their computer. This tool will allow you to access your work in your browser as you would on a normal website. _Note: if you ever dragged and dropped an HTML file into your browser you might have noticed how images don't load and display as a broke image icon_. To kill this process, hold `ctrl + c`. Otherwise you will not be able to type in any other commands in that terminal window.

**Use `http-server` to continue your work on the web typography exercise we started today.**

### In Class assignment

Bring in your composition from the week 4 in-class exercise. We will use that as a jumping off point for this in-class exercise. We will be using the knowledge garnered from the videos above to give your composition more meaning.
