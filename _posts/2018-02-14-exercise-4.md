# Exercise 4: Web Typography - @font-face

## Spill over from in class work
This week we managed to merge our changes from our `add_git_info_{YOUR NAME}` branch to the `master` branch. We did this through a **Pull Request**. We dealt with the issues of conflict resolution when we attempted to merge changes. 

As a refresher, I'm linking to this [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfT0WrChMrM) that explains the concepts we spent time in class reviewing. 

For those of you who are still lost, please take the time to watch this youtube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-y_2zWrIE&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkFiqHnNaxpOPhh9tSWMXIF). The playlist has a series of videos explaining all the concepts we've been covering in class over the last few weeks. I urge you to watch the videos discussing the Git topics you're still fuzzy about.

### Prepare for next class

Last week we made a branch from my class website modifying the bill of rights files. We debugged them and some of you pushed them up to my class site's repo. However, we need those files to make it to your site's repo.

I expect all of you to have added the bill of rights assignment to your Lab class repo by next class. You will need to do the following:

- Open your terminal and navigate to the repo for the `PUCD-2126.github.io` lab class site using the `cd` command. You all cloned that repo in different locations on your computer so you'll need to remember where you put it.
- Checkout your bill of rights branch in your local copy of the `PUCD-2126.github.io` repo.
- Open Finder and navigate to YOUR class website repo.
- Create a new directory, call it **bill_of_rights**
- Copy/paste the bill of rights html and css files from the `PUCD-2126.github.io` repo to the directory you just created (**bill_of_rights**) in **YOUR** class website repo
- Use git in your terminal to add, commit, push those files in the **bill_of_rights** directory up to your master branch.

Keep in mind it's safer to checkout a branch for committing and pushing before you merge to master via a pull request -- just like we did today in class. However, since you are not collaborating with the rest of your classmates on your personal website it is possible for you to directly push up to master. In the future, however, we'll be creating branches to work on and merging into master using pull requests. So start getting into the habit.

- typography for the web

##### Readings & other media
- [What is @font-face](http://www.font-face.com/): click on & read both **What is @font-face** & **How do i use @font-face** sections
- [Using @font-face](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face/) BY CHRIS COYIER - Read this whole article. We will be using these code snippets in class in order to implement web typography on your class sites.
- [Choosing web fonts - beginners guide](https://design.google/library/choosing-web-fonts-beginners-guide/)

##### Further exploration:
- [MDN @font-face docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face)

### In Class assignment

Make sure you've downloaded a copy of CSS notes for professionals e-book I included last week. We will be going thru chapter 7.

Keep in mind that your previous readings and media knowledge will come in handy when we do the in-class exercise! So if you haven't gone thru the readings and media or you've simply forgotten, DO SO BEFORE COMING INTO CLASS! Unfortunately, we will have to forge ahead.

- Visit the [www.unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/collections/curated) and select an image. You will use this as your background image
- Grab some [ipsum here](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/lorem-ipsum-generator/). Ensure you select some paragraphs with `<p>` tags.
- Visit [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) and select 2, no more than 3, fonts to use for a composition.
- Similar to the demo, create a composition using **size**, **weight**, **spacing**, **style**, and **color**
