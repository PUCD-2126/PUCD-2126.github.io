### In Class assignment
- open your browser and navigate to your [github](https://github.com/) profile.
- under the "your repositories" section click on "new repository" ![](https://cl.ly/pCEC/Image%202018-01-31%20at%207.30.43%20AM.png)
- on the next page give your repo a name. You can feel free to include a readme file or not.
- when you are taken to your repo's page go to the settings page for this repo.
- scroll down to the section titled "github pages" (side note: you can also just do a find on that page for those words.)
- under the source dropdown select "master branch"

Congratulations, you have set up github as a host for your website! Create an "index.html" file in a directory on your computer, push it up to this repo, and watch the magic happen at http://{your github username}.github.io/{the name of your repo}
