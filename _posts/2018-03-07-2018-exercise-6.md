# Exercise 7: Color me bad: Gradients, Shapes, and drawing with CSS

This week we took a look at what CSS3 has to offer when it comes to graphics. 

### Prepare for next class

Use the concepts we learned in class to create a drawing of your own. Your drawing can be abstract or representational as long as you use pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, box-shadow, and shapes to create it. Keep in mind that you will need to use the concepts we've learned in previous weeks as well. Your understanding of positioning & document flow will be important for this project so refer to the sources from week 5 to position shapes and other elements. I encourage you to refer to [today's demo](https://github.com/PUCD-2126/PUCD-2126.github.io/tree/master/gradients-drawing) for assistance with code. Some other examples can be found [here](https://codepen.io/sashatran/full/BpoLeE/)

Come prepared with your drawings next class; we will be working on animations and your work this week will be a jumping off point for next weeks' assignments.
