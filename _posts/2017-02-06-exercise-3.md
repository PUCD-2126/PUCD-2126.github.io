# Exercise 3: Formatted Poem
Take **[this HTML document](/selectorDoc)** and style it with CSS. The main goal this week is to experiment with what you can do using the CSS selectors we discussed in class.
**Select 6** (2 from basic selectors, 2 combinators, 2 pseudo-elements) and style them as you wish. If you're feeling especially creative give a pseudo-class a try.

##### Concepts:
- basic selectors
  - Type - Element names
  - Class
  - id
  - universal selectors
  - attribute selectors
- combinators
  - adjacent sibling selector ( + )
  - general sibling ( ~ )
  - child ( > )
  - descendant selector (  )
- pseudo-elements
  - ::after
  - ::before
  - ::first-letter
  - ::first-line
  - ::selection
  - ::backdrop
- pseudo-classes
  - [too many to list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)
