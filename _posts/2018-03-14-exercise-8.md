# Exercise 8: Movement: Animations & transitions

Today we went over how to declare, customize, and implement animations. We also explored the transitions api. I referenced some tools in class, you can find them below. They will come in hand for this weeks exercise/assignment:

##### Links from class

- [animate css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/): demo page of all animations included in the framework.
- [animate css github page](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css): for documentation and usage, see this page.
- [cubic bezier tool](http://cubic-bezier.com/): if you want to use the bezier function for your animations, you can use this tool to get the right animation.
- [animate.css cdn links](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/animate.css/)
- [cdn for jquery library](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery/):
- [jquery documentation page](https://api.jquery.com/):

### Prepare for next class

We'll be using last week's drawings as a starting point. You will use what we learned to day to animate that drawing. Have fun with this one! How you animate this is up to you. Don't feel obligated to use jquery or any Javascript in your code, but know that it is a tool available to you. What I'll be looking for is execution and your use of the animation/transition concepts we learned this week. If you run into trouble -- as always -- don't hesitate to contact me thru slack or email.

I'll see you next class; enjoy spring break!

##### Readings & other media
- [jquery selectors tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZC-w0B2kUw): If you're fuzzy on how to make selections with jquery, watch this video. 
- [intro to Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ukg_U3CnJWI): This video does a good job at explaining fundamental concepts we will need before our next class. It will give you a foundation and prepare you for our dive into JS (Javascript) the next time we meet.
- [Book on Jquery](http://books.goalkicker.com/jQueryBook/): download this, it will be our main tool along with the api documentation linked above. Familiarize yourself with Chapter 1 & 3 -- all sections for both.
- [Book on Javascript](http://books.goalkicker.com/JavaScriptBook/): Take a look at Chapter 1 sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.6 & all of Chapter 2.
